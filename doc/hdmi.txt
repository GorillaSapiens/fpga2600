is it possible to produce hdmi output from any of the ATSAM devices?

ChatGPT

The ATSAM family of microcontrollers do not have built-in HDMI output
capabilities. However, it may be possible to interface an ATSAM
microcontroller with an external HDMI transmitter IC to achieve HDMI
output.

There are HDMI transmitter ICs available on the market that can be
interfaced with microcontrollers such as ATSAM devices to generate HDMI
output. These ICs typically require a set of digital and analog signals
to be provided by the microcontroller to generate the HDMI output signal.

The specific interface and implementation will depend on the particular
ATSAM device and HDMI transmitter IC being used, as well as the
requirements of the application. It is important to carefully review the
datasheets and reference designs for the devices in question to ensure
compatibility and proper implementation.





User

can you list some common HDMI transmitter IC ?

ChatGPT

Sure, here are a few examples of common HDMI transmitter ICs that can be
used with microcontrollers like the ATSAM devices to generate HDMI output:

Silicon Image SiI9022A - a low-power HDMI transmitter with support
for 1080p and 3D formats Analog Devices ADV7511 - a high-performance
HDMI transmitter with support for 1080p, 3D, and Deep Color formats
Intersil TW8836 - a multi-purpose video processor with HDMI transmitter
functionality, capable of supporting various resolutions and formats Texas
Instruments TFP410 - an HDMI transmitter with support for resolutions up
to WUXGA (1920x1200) and various color depths Parade Technologies PS8402A
- an HDMI 2.0 transmitter with support for 4K and HDR formats Note that
this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other HDMI transmitter
ICs available on the market with varying levels of functionality and
compatibility with different microcontroller platforms. It is important
to carefully review the datasheets and reference designs for any ICs
being considered for use in a specific application.

what's the cheapest one?

ChatGPT

The price of an HDMI transmitter IC can vary depending on several factors
such as performance, features, and quantity. However, typically, the
price of the HDMI transmitter ICs can range from a few dollars to tens
of dollars.

In terms of low-cost options, the Silicon Image SiI9022A is a relatively
inexpensive HDMI transmitter IC that can be used with microcontrollers
like the ATSAM devices. Its price typically ranges from $2 to $5 in small
quantities. However, it's important to keep in mind that the final cost
of the overall system will depend on other factors such as the cost of
the microcontroller, PCB, and other components required for the design.





User

can the SiI9022A  take NTSC composite as an input?

ChatGPT

No, the Silicon Image SiI9022A HDMI transmitter IC does not have the
capability to directly accept NTSC composite video as an input.

The SiI9022A is designed to accept digital video data in the form of
HDMI or DVI signals. It does not have an analog video input interface,
such as composite or component video. Therefore, an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) would be required to convert the NTSC composite video
signal into a digital format compatible with the SiI9022A.

If you need to use NTSC composite video as an input, you may need to
consider an alternative HDMI transmitter IC that includes an analog
video input interface, or use an external ADC to convert the analog
video signal to digital before feeding it into the SiI9022A.





User

can you name some inexpensive ones?

ChatGPT

Certainly, here are a few examples of HDMI transmitter ICs that have an
analog video input interface and can be used with microcontrollers like
the ATSAM devices:

CH7026 - an HDMI transmitter IC with an integrated analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) for composite and component video inputs. It supports
resolutions up to 1080p and is available for under $5 in small quantities.

IT6613 - an HDMI transmitter IC with support for analog composite and
component video inputs through an external ADC. It supports resolutions
up to 1080p and is available for under $4 in small quantities.

ANX9021 - an HDMI transmitter IC with an integrated analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) for composite and component video inputs. It supports
resolutions up to 1080p and is available for under $5 in small quantities.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list and there may be other HDMI
transmitter ICs available that are inexpensive and support analog video
inputs. It's important to review the datasheets and reference designs
for any ICs being considered for use in a specific application to ensure
compatibility and proper implementation.
